# ALA7 - A Leopold's APA 7 for his thesis

This is a LaTeX template for a thesis written in APA 7th edition style. It is based on the [apa7](https://ctan.org/pkg/apa7) class, which is a LaTeX implementation of the APA 7th edition guidelines.

The original repo is [here](https://github.com/dan-weiss/apa7-latex-cls-source/blob/master/apa7/apa7.dtx). But I did not intend to use the `.dtx` format. Instead, I lean towards the plain cls template. Tedious it may be, but it is easier to understand and modify.

## Todos

- [ ] Fix appendix format
- [ ] Declare only the thesis option. 
      I will not use it for other purposes. When it comes to publishing, I will use the `apa7` package. Everything now is modified based on the `man` option.
  - [x] Rename the `man` related stuff to `thesis`
- [ ]
